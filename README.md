## Welcome to the Alyxia CTF!

Alyxia CTF is a global 7 week contest built around one premise, being the best. During the contest you will be directly competing with other people to rank up a constantly changing leaderboard. Sometimes being the best means finding an unconventional way to win, which is why cheating is *allowed.* All of our pages have been rigorously stress tested against hacking, reverse engineering, and other means of cheating, so if you successfully cheat you will not be penalized, rather you will be rewarded. 

We love what we do here at Alyxia, but some people still dont know about our life changing research and development teams. If you dont know what we do, we encourage you to check out the [Life at alyxia](insert url here) article.

Every cypher, programming language, and puzzle in the CTF is documented complete with examples on this site, so we encourage you to read it in full before starting work on puzzles, and to keep it open when you're solving puzzles, it may be invaluable.
