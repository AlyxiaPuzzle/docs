# Bacon's Cipher
Bacon's cipher or the Baconian cipher is a method of steganographic message encoding devised by Francis Bacon in 1605. A message is concealed in the presentation of text, rather than its content.

To encode a message, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five of the letters 'A' or 'B'. This replacement is a 5-bit binary encoding and is done according to the alphabet of the Baconian cipher (from the Latin Alphabet), shown below:

|letter|  a   |  b   |  c   |  d   |  e   |  f   |  g   |  h   | i, j |  k   |  l   |  m   |  n   |  o   |  p   |  q   |  r   |  s   |  t   |  u   |  v   |  w   |  x   |  y   |  z   |
